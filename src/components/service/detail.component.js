            A few years ago, Southeast Asian ecommerce skyrocketed beyond precedent. However, with the rise of Lazada, Zalora, and Shopee, a new problem arose – the lack of logistics. Customers needed to get their packages delivered quickly and reliably. Demand just couldn’t cope.
            <br/><br/>
            Thankfully, a host of last-mile logistics services have spearheaded efforts to improve logistics in their respective countries. Ahead of this pack, Ninja Van’s Chang Wen Lai brings his flavour of tech-enabled logistics across the entire Southeast Asia region, apart from his home base in Singapore.
            <br/><br/>
            Catch Chang Wen at Tech in Asia Singapore 2018’s Main Stage on May 15 as he shares insights on the company’s challenges, scaling across Asia, and lessons throughout his journey in his fireside titled “No easy fleet: How Ninja Van defied roadblocks to be the last mile heroes”.
            <br/><br/>
            Fast fashion
            Chang Wen’s first entrepreneurial project was Marcella, a startup designed to solve a man’s need for affordable but tailored apparel. Strangely, he didn’t even have prior experience with fashion. In fact, he would often joke that he doesn’t even have fashion sense. Regardless, Marcella succeeded in giving Chang Wen some valuable startup experience.
            <br/><br/>
            However, as Marcella progressed, demand quickly grew to unmanageable proportions. Customers started to complain about late deliveries and often ran into problems with unreliable courier services.
            <br/><br/>
            That was when Chang Wen and the co-founders decided to take matters into their own hands. As a result, Ninja Van was born in 2014.
